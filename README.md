### ETL---ABI-Data-System
This repository houses the code and documentation for our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The primary goal of this ETL workflow is to extract data from various sources, apply data transformations, and load it into our data storage for further analysis.
## ETL Workflow
Our ETL workflow consists of the following stages:
1. Data Extraction: We source data from multiple data providers, including APIs, databases, and external files, to collect relevant datasets for analysis.

2. Data Transformation: The extracted data undergoes a series of transformations to clean, structure, and enrich it. These transformations may include data cleansing, aggregation, joining, and data type conversion.

3. Data Loading: The transformed data is loaded into our data warehouse or database, making it readily available for reporting, analytics, and other downstream processes.

## Tools and Technologies
I leverage the following tools and technologies for our ETL process:

-Programming Language: We use Python for scripting and data manipulation.

-Data Processing: Libraries such as pandas and NumPy are employed for data processing and transformation.

-ETL Framework: Apache Spark is used for large-scale data processing and transformation tasks.

-Data Storage: The final processed data is stored in our SQL-based data warehouse.

## Data Sources
Our ETL pipeline sources data from MongoDB, where data is sent back from the server.

## Data Output
The outcome of our ETL pipeline is a structured dataset stored in our data warehouse. This dataset serves as the foundation for generating reports, creating visualizations, and conducting in-depth data analysis.

## How to Use
To utilize this ETL process, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository folder.
4. Run the extraction script (extract.py) to collect the data.
5. Execute the transformation script (transform.py) to clean and structure the data.
6. Run the loading script (load.py) to populate your data storage with the processed data.
## Contributions and Feedback
I welcome contributions, suggestions, and bug reports from the community. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request to engage in discussions and contribute to this project.

Feel free to customize this description to match the specifics of your ETL project, including the tools, technologies, and data sources you're using.
